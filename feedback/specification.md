Project Spec Feedback
=====================

### Product Backlog (10/10)
+ Nice backlog of the appropriate granularity

### Data Models (10/10)
Overall, good job with models. Some questions/suggestions:
+ What is duration? Seconds?
+ You shouldn't use floating point numbers for monetary values. Floating point
    error makes it poorly suited for this application
    - Count cents with an integer rather than a floating point

### Wireframes or Mock-ups (10/10)
+ Are demand posts also searched in the same place as selling items? You
    probably want a separate page to search for demand posts, since it doesn't
    make sense for buyers to see other buyers when they search.

### Sprint 1 Planning (9.9/10)
+ Sprint owner isn't specified

+ This generally seems like a good target for Sprint 1. You should aim to meet
    all of your goals.

### Total Score (39.9/40)
