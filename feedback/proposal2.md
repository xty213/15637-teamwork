Project proposal feedback

### Bailey
The new project proposal seems to be a much more reasonable project idea. I
think that in order to have a project of the appropriate scope, you should aim
to meet most of your additional features. Specifically, I think that the Demand
posting and message box would be the most useful and interesting features. It
may be also interesting and would be a great learning experience to integrate
with the PayPal or Venmo APIs for payment options.

This looks much more doable, and it's likely that you'd be able to finish up 
the extra features you mentioned. In particular, I'd add email, as that adds
a unique feature to your app that isn't represented elsewhere, from what I 
can tell. If you're feeling adventurous, you may want to look into adding a
real-time feature to the bidding price, or to the messaging feature.
