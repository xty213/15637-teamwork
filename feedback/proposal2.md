Project proposal feedback
==================

**Team number**: 118<br>

### Bailey
The new project proposal seems to be a much more reasonable project idea. I
think that in order to have a project of the appropriate scope, you should aim
to meet most of your additional features. Specifically, I think that the Demand
posting and message box would be the most useful and interesting features. It
may be also interesting and would be a great learning experience to integrate
with the PayPal or Venmo APIs for payment options.

### Eliot
The scope of this project looks much better for your final project. I think a 
lot of your key features have overlap with Grumblr and should not be too 
difficult to implement. You should definitely pick a couple of your additional
features to try to implement to your application to ensure you meet the 
requirements of the final project. I like the auction feature and definitely
think you could add a lot to that.


### Salem
This looks much more doable, and it's likely that you'd be able to finish up 
the extra features you mentioned. In particular, I'd add email, as that adds
a unique feature to your app that isn't represented elsewhere, from what I 
can tell. If you're feeling adventurous, you may want to look into adding a
real-time feature to the bidding price, or to the messaging feature.
