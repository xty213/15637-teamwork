Project proposal feedback
==================

**Team number**: 118<br>
**Team name**: VisualWriters<br>
**Team members**: hquan, tianyux

### Bailey
I am a little bit afraid that this project may be too ambitious, and possibly the difficult parts don't focus enough on the goals of the course. Your project will definitely depend on having a very well constructed and feature filled front end (lots of javascript). This will take a lot of time to develop, but will not be that beneficial in demontstrating understanding of the core concepts of the course. Essentially this is just a risky project, if done well it could still get a good grade, but you could potentially end up putting a lot of work into it and getting a poor grade if the focus is not correct.

### Eliot
The scope of this project seems pretty large considering your team size and the timeframe of this project. Creating an engine can be pretty difficult especially compared to create a single game because of the customization that must be built in. It seems like just in your critical features, there will need to be a lot of time spent to complete all of them.

### Salem
This seems fairly ambitions. Structuring these visual novels may take a bit of work, and how you represent this in the database should be well thought through. You might want to consider using some sort of game engine to help make things on the client-side easier. I've heard good things about Crafty.js (http://craftyjs.com/). Lastly, I'd recommend staying away from allowing users to submit custom CSS, as this could lead to a lot of display headaches and malicious code.
